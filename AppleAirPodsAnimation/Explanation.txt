Ever wondered how this works?
As Cs student we shoould think about it

Anyone of you can you guess how this is working 

As you can see it works on the basis of scrolling as we scroll the animation/transition is getting changed

on the board explain them this

Lets understand this with an example

We have seen books right which have multiple images on each page , when we flip the pages we see some effect , its the same here 

resizeCanvas();

onLoad - resizeCanvas() & load all the images; also explain how we got the link for the images

We need to divide the whole page into parts based upon total frames that we have 

now coming to the main part if the code is to caluculate to show which frame to show and when , now first we need to convert it to fraction
